# Linkedin API for Python

Programmatically search profiles, send messages, and find jobs. All with a regular Linkedin user account.

No "official" API access required - just use a valid Linkedin account!

**Caution**: This library is not officially supported by LinkedIn. Using it might violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service. Use it at your own risk.

## Installation

> Python >= 3.10 required

### Troubleshooting

#### I keep getting a `CHALLENGE`

Linkedin will throw you a curve ball in the form of a Challenge URL. We currently don't handle this, and so you're kinda screwed. We think it could be only IP-based (i.e. logging in from different location). Your best chance at resolution is to log out and log back in on your browser.

**Known reasons for Challenge** include:

- 2FA
- Rate-limit - "It looks like youâ€™re visiting a very high number of pages on LinkedIn.". Note - n=1 experiment where this page was hit after ~900 contiguous requests in a single session (within the hour) (these included random delays between each request), as well as a bunch of testing, so who knows the actual limit.

Please add more as you come across them.

#### Search problems

- Mileage may vary when searching general keywords like "software" using the standard `search` method. They've recently added some smarts around search whereby they group results by people, company, jobs etc. if the query is general enough. Try to use an entity-specific search method (i.e. search_people) where possible.

## How it works

This project attempts to provide a simple Python interface for the Linkedin API.

> Do you mean the [legit Linkedin API](https://developer.linkedin.com/)?

NO! To retrieve structured data, the [Linkedin Website](https://linkedin.com) uses a service they call **Voyager**. Voyager endpoints give us access to pretty much everything we could want from Linkedin: profiles, companies, connections, messages, etc. - anything that you can see on linkedin.com, we can get from Voyager.

This project aims to provide complete coverage for Voyager.

[How does it work?](#deep-dive)

### Deep dive

Voyager endpoints look like this:

```text
https://www.linkedin.com/voyager/api/identity/profileView/tom-quirk
```

Or, more clearly

```text
 ___________________________________ _______________________________
|             base path             |            resource           |
https://www.linkedin.com/voyager/api /identity/profileView/tom-quirk
```

They are authenticated with a simple cookie, which we send with every request, along with a bunch of headers.

To get a cookie, we POST a given username and password (of a valid Linkedin user account) to `https://www.linkedin.com/uas/authenticate`.

### Find new endpoints

We're looking at the Linkedin website and we spot some data we want. What now?

The following describes the most reliable method to find relevant endpoints:

1. `view source`
1. `command-f`/search the page for some keyword in the data. This will exist inside of a `<code>` tag.
1. Scroll down to the **next adjacent element** which will be another `<code>` tag, probably with an `id` that looks something like

   ```html
   <code style="display: none" id="datalet-bpr-guid-3900675">
     {"request":"/voyager/api/identity/profiles/tom-quirk/profileView","status":200,"body":"bpr-guid-3900675"}
   </code>
   ```

The value of `request` is the url! ðŸ¤˜

You can also use the `network` tab in you browsers developer tools, but you will encounter mixed results.

### How Clients query Voyager

linkedin.com uses the [Rest-li Protocol](https://linkedin.github.io/rest.li/spec/protocol) for querying data. Rest-li is an internal query language/syntax where clients (like linkedin.com) specify what data they want. It's conceptually similar to the GraphQL.

Here's an example of making a request for an organisation's `name` and `groups` (the Linkedin groups it manages):

```text
/voyager/api/organization/companies?decoration=(name,groups*~(entityUrn,largeLogo,groupName,memberCount,websiteUrl,url))&q=universalName&universalName=linkedin
```

The "querying" happens in the `decoration` parameter, which looks like the following:

```text
(
    name,
    groups*~(entityUrn,largeLogo,groupName,memberCount,websiteUrl,url)
)
```

Here, we request an organisation name and a list of groups, where for each group we want `largeLogo`, `groupName`, and so on.

Different endpoints use different parameters (and perhaps even different syntaxes) to specify these queries. Notice that the above query had a parameter `q` whose value was `universalName`; the query was then specified with the `decoration` parameter.

In contrast, the `/search/cluster` endpoint uses `q=guided`, and specifies its query with the `guided` parameter, whose value is something like

```text
List(v->PEOPLE)
```

It could be possible to document (and implement a nice interface for) this query language - as we add more endpoints to this project, I'm sure it will become more clear if such a thing would be possible (and if it's worth it).
